1) DNS

    a. According to the WebPagetest data, how many DNS lookups were performed by the client? 
    How many of the lookups were redundant (i.e., the lookup was for the same domain name)? 
    
    Answer: We have 12 seperate DNS requests made. 
    
    b. Assuming no DNS records were cached at the local DNS server, what DNS queries did the
    local DNS server need to issue to satisfy the client’s first lookup?
    
    Answer: 
    
    Name Server Queried     | Records Returned
    ________________________|__________________________________________
    a.root-servers.net      | org, NS, d0.org.afilias-nst.org
                            | d0.org.afilias-nst.org, A, 199.19.57.1
    ________________________|__________________________________________ 
    d0.org.afilias-nst.org  | code.org, NS, ns-1497.awsdns-59.org

    c. Assuming the local DNS server cached all records it retrieved while satisfying the client’s first 
    lookup, what DNS queries did the local DNS server need to issue to satisfy the client’s second 
    lookup? For each query specify what server was queried and what records were received.

    Answer: 
    
    Name Server Queried     | Records Returned
    ________________________|__________________________________________
    a.root-servers.net      | org, NS, d0.org.afilias-nst.org
                            | d0.org.afilias-nst.org, A, 199.19.57.1

2) Clouds & CDNs

    a. Which domain names (if any) resolved to a node in Amazon EC2? In which EC2 region was 
    the node located? Use the list of Amazon EC2 public IP ranges by region (download ip-
    ranges.json file from that page) to help you answer this question.
    
    Answer: 
    
    http://www.code.org (50.17.209.250) --> 50.16.0.0/15
    http://code.org (54.230.53.206) --> 54.230.0.0/16
    
    b. Which domain names (if any) resolved to a node in the Akamai or EdgeCast CDN?
    
    Answer: 
    
    c. According to the WebPagetest data, how many HTTP requests were issued to each CDN 
    node? Over how many connections were these requests issued? 
    
    Answer: 
    
    d. How many of the requested web objects were already stored in the CDN’s cache? (Hint: look 
    at the X-Cache field in the HTTP response header)
