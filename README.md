# Simple DNS Server

An implementation of a fairly simple DNS server for my networks class project. It is not parrellized and does not do anything by the means of caching.

It does have merit a project worthy of staying here on my github after the course though. I'm renaming and adding the readme so it can be public while still being difficult for students to find.
